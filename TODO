Part 2:
  verify that the home page is good for getting people:
    1) Lets ensure that the home page has the 3 games as a demo of the games.
    2) Lets ensure that the home page has a button to go to the about page.
    3) Lets ensure that the home page has a button to go to the games page.:
      - right now its a section on the home page

  Need to setup some sort of acount sign up and login system.:
    1) Firebase to allow people to sign up and login
    2) Save the users progress to the database for their games
    2.5) Perhaps have a sort of assighned teacher to the user, so they can track their progress and get help from the teacher.
    3) Have a sort of leaderboard system, so people can see how they are doing compared to others.
    4) Have a sort of rewards system, so people can earn rewards for their progress.
    5) Have a sort of achievements system, so people can earn achievements for their progress.
    6) Have a sort of badges system, so people can earn badges for their progress.
    7) Have a sort of leaderboard system, so people can see how they are doing compared to others.
    8) Have a sort of rewards system, so people can earn rewards for their progress.
    9) Have a sort of achievements system, so people can earn achievements for their progress.

    Lets also make it so when they sign in its a different dash board, and they can see their progress and their games:
      1) Lets have a button to go back to the home page.
      2) Lets have a button to go to the games page.
      ☐ lets ensure that this game page is a different page, and not just a section on the home page
      3) Lets have a button to go to the about page.
