## 🎮 BETA GAME COMPLETED
  ✔ "Gods of Olympus" Memory Game @started(25-06-09 22:45) @done(25-06-09 23:15) @lasted(30m)
    ✔ TypeScript interfaces and game types
    ✔ Zustand store for state management
    ✔ Greek gods data with 12 olympian deities
    ✔ Animated game components with Framer Motion
    ✔ Three difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
    ✔ Responsive design for all devices
    ✔ Victory and pause states
    ✔ Score tracking and statistics
    This is a memory game with 12 greek gods, its a matching game where you find
    a pair of the matching gods. There 3 difficulty levels, easy, medium and hard.
    The easy level has 12 cards, the medium level has 18 cards, and the hard level has 24 cards.
    The game is a timed game, you have 1 minute to find all the pairs. This
    could be applied to a english word and a differnt language word.

## 2) Game Architecture & Planning:
  ☐ Define game concept and core mechanics
  ☐ Create wireframes/mockups for game screens
  ☐ Design game state structure
  ☐ Plan component hierarchy
  ☐ Define TypeScript interfaces for game entities
  ☐ Setup folder structure:
    * /components/game
    * /hooks/game
    * /stores
    * /types
    * /utils/game

## 3) Core Game Components
  ☐ Create GameBoard/GameArea component
  ☐ Build Player/Character component
  ☐ Implement game entities (enemies, items, etc.)
  ☐ Create UI overlay components (HUD, menus)
  ☐ Build responsive layout with Tailwind
  ☐ Add Greek-themed styling and animations

## 4) Game Logic & Systems
  ☐ Implement game loop using useEffect/requestAnimationFrame
  ☐ Create collision detection system
  ☐ Build scoring/progression system
  ☐ Implement game state management (playing, paused, game over)
  ☐ Add sound effects and background music
  ☐ Create save/load functionality (localStorage)

## 5) User Interface & Experience
  ☐ Design main menu with Greek mythology theme
  ☐ Create settings/options menu
  ☐ Build game over/victory screens
  ☐ Implement responsive design for mobile
  ☐ Add keyboard and touch controls
  ☐ Create loading states and transitions
  ☐ Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## 6) Performance & Optimization
  ☐ Optimize rendering performance
  ☐ Implement object pooling for game entities
  ☐ Add image optimization and lazy loading
  ☐ Minimize bundle size
  ☐ Test performance on various devices

## 7) Testing & Quality
  ☐ Write unit tests for game logic
  ☐ Add integration tests for components
  ☐ Test cross-browser compatibility
  ☐ Mobile device testing
  ☐ Performance testing and profiling

## 8) Deployment & Distribution
  ☐ Setup Vercel deployment
  ☐ Configure custom domain (optional)
  ☐ Add analytics tracking (Google Analytics/Vercel Analytics)
  ☐ Setup error tracking (Sentry)
  ☐ Create social media preview images
  ☐ Add PWA capabilities for mobile installation

## 9) Greek Theme Implementation

  ☐ Design Greek-inspired color palette
  ☐ Add Greek fonts and typography
  ☐ Create mythology-based characters/enemies
  ☐ Add Greek temple/architecture backgrounds
  ☐ Include Greek mythology storyline/lore
  ☐ Add appropriate sound effects (epic music, etc.)

## 10) Advanced Features (Optional)
  ☐ Multiplayer functionality
  ☐ Leaderboards/high scores
  ☐ Achievement system
  ☐ Power-ups and special abilities
  ☐ Multiple game modes
